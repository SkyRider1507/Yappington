A Discord TTS Bot

**Features**:
- Speaks messages sent by users in a Discord VC Text Channel. This is done by a slash command `join`, once the Bot joins it begins to listen to the channel and will speak your messages!
- Shortcuts. Want to be able to shorten words but the full word still read out loud? Shorcuts allows you to do just that. you just add your shortcut. e.g. `jk = Just kidding`
  if you type `jk`, the bot will say `just kidding`
